# Console_Navigator
This program is a console application for testing the functionality of the implemented my_graph and my_graph_algorithms libraries 

The program is implemented with Makefile with goals: console, tests, clean

The console interface provides the following functionality:
    1. Load the original graph from a file.
    2. Traverse the graph in breadth and print the result to the console.   
    3. Traverse the graph in depth and print the result to the console.
    4. Find the shortest path between any two vertices and print the result to the console.
    5. Find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in the graph and print the result matrix to the console.
    6. Search for the minimum spanning tree in the graph and print the resulting adjacency matrix to the console.
    7. Solve the Salesman problem, with output of the resulting route and its length to the console.
    8. Compares 3 methods for solving the traveling salesman problem
